### Getting Started 

On the [FreeCodeCamp project page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/learn-sql-by-building-a-student-database-part-1/build-a-student-database-part-1), click on the "Start the project"
button. 

It will open up the Gitpod website and require you to sign in. Hit the `Continue with GitHub` 
button and proceed. The website will open up a new Gitpod workspace with the project loaded up. 

Hit the `F1` key on the keyboard to open up the command dropdown. Either type in the search box
or find "CodeRoad:Start" in the dropdown. Hit enter. 

A new tab will appear on the page with the instructions. Follow the directions and hit run when you
complete the tasks. 

## Working on the project locally 

### Prerequisites

- The [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- The [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) for
VS Code. 
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

#### Obtaining the prerequisites

The very step is to open up the download page for [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). Click on 
the option appropriate option for the computer; whether it is running Linux, macOS, or Windows. 

If virtualization is not enabled on the operating system, please check the links on the Docker page. 

Once everything is ready. Click on the applicable "Download" button and run it. Let Docker install and 
setup what it needs to run. 

Next [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) needs to be installed. This will
be used to write code and display the instructions for the project. Hit the download button for the correct operating 
system, and install it. 

Once Visual Studio Code is installed, an extension is needed to use a Docker container as a development 
environment. Hit the "install" button on the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers). 

Once the extension is enabled, it is time to proceed to the final step: installing git. Git will provide 
command-line access to remote source control repositories like GitHub. Navigate to the Git [download page](https://git-scm.com/downloads) 
and hit the link for the computer's operating system. Install instructions will vary depending on what operating
system is used. 

## Running the project



1) Clone the RDB Alpha repo to your computer with `git clone https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/rdb-alpha`

2) Open a terminal, navigate to the `rdb-alpha` directory, and open VS Code with `code.`

3) In VS Code, open the command palette with `Ctrl / Cmd + Shift + P`. Then, enter and run `Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`

4) A new VS Code window will open and begin building the Docker image. It will take several minutes to build the first time

5) Once the image is finished building, open the command palette again with `Ctrl / Cmd + Shift + P`, enter and run `CodeRoad: Start`. The command won't be available until the extension has finished installing in your container

6) In the CodeRoad window, click `Start New Tutorial`

7) Click the `URL` tab and enter the URL of the `tutorial.json` file for the project you want to start (ex: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/learn-bash-by-building-a-boilerplate/main/tutorial.json) Full list of available tutorials below.

8) Click the "Start" button to start the lessons
